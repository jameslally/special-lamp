Head of Engineering Head of AI Camp Australia, East Malven, Victoria July 2017 Present

In my role as Head of Engineering and Head of AI at Camp Australia, I led a comprehensive transformation of the companys technology stack, driving a strategic migration from on-premises and VM-hosted environments to a fully cloud-native Azure solution. This shift enhanced scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency. I played a key role in migrating the enterprise data architecture to Microsoft Fabric. This enabling advanced analytics and Generative AI capabilities and workflow automation.

Recruited, built, and led a multi-discipline, multi-region, delivery team of 20+ professionals spanning engineering, data, product management, and operations, fostering a culture of innovation, collaboration, and technical excellence across geographically dispersed teams. I architected and delivered a cloud-native platform leveraging Azure, Kubernetes and ESB technologies, enabling scalable and event-driven business operations.

As part of a strategic migration from a monolithic architecture, I led the transformation to a microservices-based model, successfully developing 100+ microservices. I implemented a feature release branching strategy, with pull request gates and automated testing integrated into our Azure DevOps pipelines, ensuring consistent quality and efficient delivery. This transformation significantly improved scalability, flexibility, and deployment speed while reducing dependencies between services.

Created a new mobile development capability by guiding the end-to-end development of a mobile application Android iOS, from concept to market, significantly enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency. Built on this foundation by introducing a ReactJS-powered web portal that reused core back-end gateways, ensuring consistency across platforms and minimising duplication.

To strengthen engineering governance and delivery reliability, I established a formal Change Advisory Board CAB process to review, approve, and document all production changes, ensuring alignment with operational, security, and business priorities. Implemented rigorous quality gates within Azure DevOps pipelines, including automated testing, static code analysis, and deployment validation checks, to uphold code quality and release confidence. Additionally, I introduced a restrictive pull request approval policy, enforcing multiple mandatory reviewers and preventing direct merges into protected branches. These practices significantly reduced production defects, improved traceability, and ensured a controlled, auditable path to production.

Embedded Agile and DevOps practices across engineering teams, enhancing collaboration, innovation and iterative delivery. I ensured strong security and compliance by applying OWASP and NIST standards, aligning with organisational governance frameworks. To scale delivery capacity and enhance project velocity, I successfully led third-party partnerships and integrations, bringing on LTI Mindtree, BCS, and Sonata Software.

To support responsible adoption of Generative AI, I organised company-wide enablement initiatives, including Microsoft-led masterclasses and the rollout of an internal ethical AI usage policy, aligning emerging capabilities with organisational values and risk frameworks.

Chief Architect and Development Manager Telstra Health UK, London, UK Jan 2012 Nov 2016

During my tenure at Telstra Health UK in London, I led the transformation of the engineering function, significantly expanding the team and embedding a culture of continuous learning, innovation, and technical excellence. I introduced modern programming languages, contemporary development approaches, and automation practices that elevated engineering maturity and delivery velocity. Under my leadership, the team delivered large-scale analytics platforms leveraging NHS hospital data, enabling trusted and timely insights that directly supported national healthcare policy and clinical decision-making.

Spearheaded the integration of monthly-updated predictive models for patient mortality, length of stay, and readmission risk into production systems, combining current and historical NHS datasets. In collaboration with Imperial College London, I ensured sensitive patient data was anonymised in accordance with stringent data protection standards, ensuring compliance with regulations.

Implemented data-driven healthcare solutions that enabled better decision-making through analytics and data visualisation. I also developed secure and high-performance data pipelines using .NET and MassTransit over RabbitMQ, ensuring the safe handling of sensitive health information while adhering to regulatory standards.

In terms of infrastructure, I deployed containerised applications on a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster, which ensured consistency and efficient resource utilisation across environments. I also championed security best practices, contributing to the successful ISO 27001 certification for information security, underscoring our commitment to maintaining high standards of data protection.

Additionally, I designed high-availability architecture to ensure 247 access to critical healthcare insights and analytics, ensuring no disruption to service. To further improve efficiency, I introduced automated testing frameworks, which enhanced code quality and accelerated release cycles.
